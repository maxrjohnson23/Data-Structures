# Data Structures

## Implementations of common Data Structures in Java

###  Common Big O Notation Complexities
   _Ordered by most to least performant_
   * O(1) - Constant
   * O(log n) - Logarithmic
   * O(n) - Linear
   * O(n^2) - Quadratic
   * O(c^n) - Exponential
   * O(n!) - Factorial

### Data Structures

1. **Stack**
    1. Properties

    2. Operations

### Data Structure Performance
| Structure | Access | Search | Insert | Delete |
| ----------|  ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  Stack    | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(1)   |
